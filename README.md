## Technologies Used:

## Unsolved Problems
- Make my app more responsive

- I was having some 500 and 400 errors. I had to change in the client ClientsController
file to inherit OpenReadController.

- I kept getting an error for undefined property of id which is use to update.
I found out that it as a spelling error.
