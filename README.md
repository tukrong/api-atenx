## Version
v1: Rails API for my Database.

v2: Express for my Database.

## Planning Story:

- Create my app.
- Create my database.
- Deploy my app.
- Scaffold my resource to reference it to user.
- Make sure everything is correctly.
- Migrate my database.
- Make sure I have all my references.


## Future plans
- I would like to transfer everything to use express database.
- I would like to learn in the process how an express database works.
- I would like to combine different front end framework and libraries to see
how it interacts.
- I would like to learn more on using react.
- I would also like to try to use a different deploy database such as mongodb atlas. 

## Technologies Used:

- Ruby
- Ruby on rails
- Heroku
- SQL

## Unsolved Problems
- Make my app more responsive

- I was having some 500 and 400 errors. I had to change in the client ClientsController
file to inherit OpenReadController.

- I kept getting an error for undefined property of id which is use to update.
I found out that it as a spelling error.
